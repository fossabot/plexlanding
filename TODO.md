- Add some environment variables (title) into the html file.  Use server side ejs?
- Add middleware to authenticate api with plex token
  - Make sure the plex token is associated to the locked in username of the application
  - That way additional people cannot log in.
  - Have a 'reset/logout' action that can remove the locked in user account
- Convert all Angular front end code over to React + Redux.. going to be daunting
